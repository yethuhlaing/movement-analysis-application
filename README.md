# Movement analyze visualization tool for ergonomic and sport purposes

The AIRIDE project develops new learning methods and technologies based on riding simulators, student biosignal measurements and artificial intelligence, which can be used in training in the riding industry and in various research and educational institutions. In this project, Excel Software acts as a medium to analyze the simulation data. Due to the massive volume of the data, it is essentially time-consuming to extract and compare even the two columns of the excel file in which almost 720 columns exist. The efficient tool needs to be implemented to compare easily different simulation data in sport and work, pick up and visualize the critical key points and give fast feedback to an athlete or worker based on those threshold values. The solution to tackle this problem is to implement analysis algorithms with the scripting language â€“ python and produce the visualization graphs via appropriate User Interface.

# Objectives 
- Find out the tool to compare easily different tasks in sport and work
  - Task to task
  - Task to larger group average values
- Pick up and visualize the critical keypoints
- Give fast feedback to an athlete or worker based on threshold values

# Initial Solution 
- Use Excel to analyze the simulation data which takes a great deal of time
